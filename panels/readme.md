This is a panel mod build specifically for my v2.4
Its intention is to cover up the extrusions and provide better squish across my panels (while looking alittle cooler)

My panels are 3mm acrylic and 5mm foam
The gap between the frame and the top lip of these is 7.5mm

BOM:
- 8 Vertical Midspannage retainers    (8 for rearpanel mod)
- 12 Horizontal midspannage retainers (11 for rearpanel mod)
- 20 Cornerage retainers              (18 for rearpanel mod)
- 120  m3x16's
- 120  T-nuts and/or roll in nuts

you wanted to mount a spoolholder to your frame? uhhh..... gl with that ig lolololol
