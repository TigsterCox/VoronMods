A Collection of my god aweful voron mods consisting of

- Backpanel Cpap & Monolith
    - Use of a extra Clicky Clack Door frame for rear monolith spacing and cpap mounting

- Deck covers
    - Use of 5mm Foam to cover the gaps in the bottom deck panel of the 2.4

- Desk Rack
    - use of spare 130mm extrusion for a small Desktop server rack (idk why this is a "voron mod")

- HX0 N17
    - a (bad) modification of the HexZero gantry for Nima17 support

- Panels
    - a modification of the stock voron clips to cover all edges of the frame and support my 5mm foam

- Random STL's
    - as it sounds, a random collection of STLs ive gathered, all having their own licenses

- Skorts
    - an attempt at a modification of a Skirt mod to better match my build

- V0 Midpanel
    - a printed midpanel, for my v0, for support with my boards setup
